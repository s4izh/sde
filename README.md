# Dotfiles

## Deployment

Can be done via the `Makefile` provided. See the diferent targets with:

```sh
make help
```

## The following is not maintained

I have my raw dotfiles in this repo,
they are meant to be deployed by my [nixos configuration](https://github.com/s4izh/nixos) (especially see [home manager](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Home_Manager)),

they also can be deployed on other distros using home-manager (reproducible option) too or via the `./install <program>` script (not well mantained, and need imperative package managing).
